CLI class goes two-level deeper after asking the user to enter the list to show a list of all best hotels for 2020, I did another level to show to user detail of each hotel and asking the user to enter the rank of the hotel to see details of each hotel (description, property, contact number, customer), I used class method self.find_by_rank(rank) to find a description hotel. The last level was about customer reviews; when you ask the user to enter the name of the customer, it appears me the review of that customer, I used class method self.find_by_name(name) to find the specific object of customer and display of his review in the screen.
